    <h1>COVID-19 Refund Claims No Longer Available</h1>
    <p class="description">
      We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges for travelers. 
      In response to the global situation, many airlines and travel agencies, including ourselves, 
      offered refunds or credit vouchers to customers whose plans were disrupted due to the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      However, as of <strong>[25 Dec 2023]</strong>, COVID-19 refund claims are no longer available.
      The refund window has officially closed, and any unclaimed vouchers or refunds are no longer
      eligible for processing.
    </p>
    <p class="additional-info">
      We encourage you to review the terms and conditions of your bookings and to stay updated 
      on any further developments regarding travel policies. Thank you for your understanding 
      during these difficult times.
